## ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Frontend Display Problems
- **❌ JavaScript Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')`
  - **Impact**: Prevents proper data initialization in UI components
  - **Scope**: Affects frontend display but not underlying WebSocket streaming
  - **Location**: Data slice operation in main application bundle

### Status Indicators
- **⚠️ Market Data Status**: Shows "error" despite functional streaming
  - **Impact**: Misleading user feedback about system health
  - **Reality**: WebSocket connection and streaming are fully operational

### Data Visualization
- **⚠️ Display Rendering**: While data streams correctly, frontend rendering needs improvement
  - **Impact**: Users cannot see visual confirmation of streaming data
  - **Backend**: All data processing and streaming working correctly
